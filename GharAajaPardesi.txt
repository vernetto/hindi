Ho koyal  kooke hook uthaye	
हो      कोयल            कूके           हूक          उठाए
ho cuckoo cry   stab raise
Ho ... a cry arises from a cuckoo bird

Yaadon ki bandook chalaye	
यादों              की            बंदूक         चलाए
memories of  gun  run
It fires the gun of memories

Koyal kooke hook uthaye	A cry arises from a cuckoo bird
Yaadon ki bandook chalaye	It fires the gun of memories
Baaghon mein jhuloon ke mausam vapas aaye re	In the orchards the season of swings has returned
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Oh ... baaghon mein jhuloon ke mausam vapas aaye re	Oh ... in the orchards the season of swings has returned
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
	
Is gaon ki anpadh mitti	The illiterate dust of this village
Padh nahin sakti teri chitthi	Is not able to read your letter
Yeh mitti tu aakar choome	When you'll come and kiss this dust
Toh is dharti ka dil jhoome	The heart of the earth will rejoice
Maana tere hain kuch sapne	We know that you have your dreams
Par hum toh hain tere apne	But we are your dear ones
Bhoolne waale humko teri yaad sataye re	Hey forgetful one, we are tormented by your absence
	
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
	
Panghat pe aayi mutiyare	Women come to the river bank
Chham chham payal ki jhankare	With ringing and jingling of the anklets
Kheton mein lehrai sarson	The fields will flow with mustard plants
Kal parson mein beete barson	In tomorrow and after ages have passed
Aaj hi aaja gaata hasta	Come back today singing and smiling
Tera rasta dekhe rasta	The path is waiting for you
Arre chuk-chuk gaadi ki seeti awaaz lagaye re	Hey even the train's whistle is calling out for you
	
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
	
Haathon mein puja ki thali	Holding the worship plates in the hand
Aayi raat suhagon waali	The night for wives has come
Oh ... chaand ko dekhoon	Oh ... I'll look at the moon
Haath mein jodhoon	I'll pray with my hands
Karva Chauth ka vrat main todhoon	I'll break the fast of Karva Chauth
Tere haath se peekar paani	After drinking water from your hands
Daasi se ban jaon rani	I'll turn from a servant into a queen
Aaj ki raat joh maange koi woh pa jaaye re	Tonight whatever anyone asks for, shall be obtained
	
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
	
Oh ... mann mitra	Oh ... pure spirit
Oh ... mann meeta	Oh ... lover of mine
De ... tenu rab de hawaale keeta	Hey ... may God keep you in his care
	
Duniya ke dastoor hain kaise	What are the world's customs like
Pagal dil majboor hain kaise	Why are these crazy hearts compelled
Ab kya sunana, ab kya kehna	What to hear, what to say
Tere mere beech yeh raina	These things must remain between us
Khatam hui yeh aankh micholi	This game of hide and seek is over
Kal jayegi meri doli	Tomorrow my palanquin will leave
Meri doli meri arthi na ban jaaye re	Don't let me palanquin become my pyre
	
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Ghar aaja pardesi tera des bulaye re	Come home foreigner to your country
Koyal kooke hook uthaye	A cry arises from a cuckoo bird
Yaadon ki bandook chalaye	It fires the gun of memories
Baaghon mein jhuloon ke mausam vapas aaye re	In the orchards the season of swings has returned
	
Oh ... mahi ve	Oh ... lover
Oh ... chan ve	Oh ... soulmate
Be jindava o sajna	My partner in love
